###  Hi there 👋

#### 📖 My story: 

I'm a mobile software engineer with over 5 years of experience, specializing in development for mobile platforms at scale. I have been working remotely for Brazil. I have proven ability in React Native.

My mission is to deliver software that has a business impact with focus and onwership. I enjoy being involved in the full application development lifecycle, from conception and implementation to deployment, maintenance and monitoring. I proactively seek to implement best practices to ensure efficient and scalable solutions.

I write high quality, well-tested code with a focus on readability and maintainability. I translate business requirements into technical specifications, fostering clear communication and efficient execution.

I enjoy the process of building new & cool things. I am really good at building fast and scalable mobile apps.
